2.1.2: Try another strategy to handle weird-length foreign data headers. Improves support for some files.

2.1.1: Improve support for some files.

2.1.0: Add --data-only option to acq2hdf5 and acq2mat. Improve marker date handling. Guess at file encodings.

2.0.0: Drop support for Python < 3.6.0. Thanks to @pvelasco, add Marker.created_at and Datafile.earliest_marker_created_at, which will give a good guess for when modern files were created.

1.0.4: Add support for files from Acqknowledge 3.0.3 and 4.2.something. Also fix string formatting for acq_markers in python 3.

1.0.3: Bug fix -- Always write Matlab files in native byte ordering.

1.0.2: Bug fix -- Fix crash when reading a mixed sampling rate file where the last channel has no bytes to read in a chunk.

1.0.1: Bug fixes -- HDF5 files with scaled data were being created improperly from compressed .acq files.

1.0.0: Re-write reading uncompressed files -- new technique is much faster, does not require reading entire data into memory, and correctly handles the end of data with mixed sampling rates. Also adds acq2hdf5 -- finally, a good format for exporting .acq files. Add UTF-8 support. Add 'time_index' to datafile, channels. Change acq2txt to write multiple channels in a tab-delimited format.

0.10.1: Use docopt everywhere.

0.10.0: Add reading markers

0.9.5: Fix reading AcqKnowledge 4.3 and 4.4 files.

0.9.4: Python 3.x compatiblity.

0.9.3: Fix bug with modern numpy

0.9.2: Add acq2txt, which (not surprisingly) turns acq files into text files.

0.9.1: Add ability to read file revision 61 (appears to be an old version 4.x for Mac). Thanks to <David.Gutman@med.nyu.edu> for bug report & example file.

0.9.0: Change MATLAB file writer to create a cell array for channels instead of the silly named struct thing.

0.8.4: Add convenience method: bioread.read_file(). Add useful __unicode__(), __str__(), and __repr__() methods to biopac.Datafile and biopac.Channel.

0.8.3: Reading uncompressed data now ~50% faster. Fixed bug in improperly scaling data converted from int to float by AcqKnowledge.

0.8.2: Rewrite algorithm to read uncompressed data; now ~15x faster.

0.8.1: Small changes to make deploying without easy_install easier.

0.8.0: Now reads compressed files from version 3.8.2 (rev 41)

0.7.1: Fix bug reading channels with different freq_dividers

0.7: Command-line utilities now accept data via stdin

0.6.8: Add support for other .acq file revisions

0.6.2: Improve error reporting in command-line utils, fix reading channel names and unit labels

0.6.1: Implement reading .acq files saved with compression

0.6: Initial public release
