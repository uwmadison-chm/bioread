"""Write the data from an AcqKnowledge file channel to a text file.

Usage:
  acq2txt [options] <acq_file>
  acq2txt -h | --help
  acq2txt --version

Options:
  --version                    Show program's version number and exit.
  -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit.
  --channel-indexes=<indexes>  The indexes of the channels to extract.
                               Separate numbers with commas. Default is to
                               extract all channels.
  -o, --outfile=<file>         Write to a file instead of standard out.
  --missing-as=<val>           What value to write where a channel is not
                               sampled. [default: ]

The first column will always be time in seconds. Channel raw values are
converted with scale and offset into native units.
